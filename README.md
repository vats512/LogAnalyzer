# LogAnalyzer

## Final Project for Cloud Computing Course

A comprehensive log management and analysis strategy is mission critical, enabling organizations to understand the relationship between operational, security, and change management events and to maintain a comprehensive understanding of their infrastructure. Log files from web servers, applications, and operating systems also provide valuable data, although in different formats, and in a random and distributed fashion.

Logs are a crucial part of any system because they give you insight into what a system is doing as well what happened. Virtually every process running on a system generates logs in some form or another. These logs are usually written to files on local disks. When your system grows to multiple hosts, managing the logs and accessing them can get complicated. 

Searching for a particular error across hundreds of log files on hundreds of servers is difficult without good tools. A common approach to this problem is to set up a centralized logging solution so that multiple logs can be aggregated in a central location. To effectively consolidate, manage, and analyze these different logs, many customers choose to implement centralized logging solutions using Elasticsearch, Logstash, and Kibana, popularly known as ELK Stack.
